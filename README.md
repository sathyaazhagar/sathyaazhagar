## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Sathya Azhagar
Hey! Iâ€™m leveling up from electronic security to cybersecurity. By day, Iâ€™m a helpdesk tech at a small company working with managed switches , setting up routers and APs, monitoring Fortinet, and installing CCTV and alarm systems. After hours, Iâ€™m working on TryHackMe every day, building VMs with Proxmox, and chasing OSCP. Check my site: [sathyaazhagar.com](https://www.sathyaazhagar.com). More work coming soon!
